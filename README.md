# Website_CoreBusiness_Classification


This project is a classification problem. A company provides insurance. Regulations prevent it
from insuring certain companies. Using their domain and homepage text, I am asked to
classify the companies' core business.

The data is saved in Parquet format as a DataFrame, split into train & test (without labels). It is
constructed of three columns: Domain <text>, Homepage <text>, label <text>. I recommend
using Colab as a platform to train the model, using their free GPU instance.
  
Note that the Other class (denoted as other) is constructed of companies whoâ€™s core business is
considered legitimate by the company in terms of providing insurance, compared to the rest of the
classes which are considered as restricted (denoted as restricted).
  
Deliverables:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Multi-Class Classification Model
3. Study of Model Bias - Given that cost of predicting a restricted company as Other is higher compared to predicting
Other as restricted.
